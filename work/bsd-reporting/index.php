          <p>This past year (2014) Darden-Gloeb-Reeder, Inc.  (DGR) came to me wanting a rebrand. DGR has been a commercial painting company in Omaha, Nebraska for the last 15 years. Dan Reeder bought the company from the previous owners, Darden and Gloeb and, as a tribute to them, kept their names in the company name.</p>
          <p>DGR wanted a brand that kept the same name, but called more attention to the current owner, Dan Reeder.</p>
          <p>I decided there was a few key things I wanted to portray through the new brand.</p>
          <p>Dan strives to offer the best possible working conditions for his workers. Many of them staying on and working for him after he bought Darden-Gloeb. He runs a honest, trustworthy, and ethical business. This was something that needed to be portrayed through the branding. I always strive to make brands that are timeless and this was no exception. I chose a monogram with a modern twist because that is how DGR works and because Darden-Gloeb-Reeder, Inc is known by many as “DGR” so a monogram just made sense.</p>
          <p>They loved the new mark and now it was time to really make it come to life. </p>

          <p>DGR had no Web presence before this rebrand so I wanted to make sure a small website was a part of the refresh. It had to be responsive, but feel like the timeless, hand crafted brand I had created.</p>
